   <h3>My Favourite place in the world is Ladakh located in India.</h3>   
   <p>
    The best time to visit Ladakh is summer, I mostly like the <b> Adventurous Road-trip</b> on Bikes 
    there in the snow and in between the mountains.Second comes the Camping and Trekking which 
    are very famous and offers a plenty of plans like mountaineering,jeep safari,Hemis National Park.
    The another important thing is <b>Magnetic Hill</b> which is famous for its scenic views and rough 
    terrain,it is also known as Phenomenal Magnetic Hill- if we leave the vechile at hill's base and 
    keep the brakes unlocked,slowly the vechile moves uphill without any support.!Apart from these I 
    also love the White Water Rafting which is also named as <b>Grand Canyon of India</b>.
