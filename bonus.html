        <h3>The White MadMan</h3>
        <p>The life of white Madman prior to the car accident that "killed" him was unknown. His body was found by a police officer 
            friend of scientist Dr. Egon Boiffard (he owed him a favor). Dr. Boiffard managed to resurrect him with the side effects of
            super human agility and precognitive abilities. He could not remember anything of his life save for his childhood hero, 
            Mr. Excitement. Dr. Boiffard named Madman after his artistic and intellectual heroes, Frank Sinatra and Albert Einstein.
            Thus, Frank Einstein was born. He was given the name "Madman" when chasing the evil Mr. Monstadt through a circus. He shot 
            himself out of a cannon and an onlooker in the crowd shouted, "He's a White Madman!"
